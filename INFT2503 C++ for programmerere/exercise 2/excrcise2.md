#Task 1
The drawings matched the outputs

#Task 2
You're trying to copy a string into a pointer that is pointing to nothing, so there is no "space" for what you are trying to copy. So basically your trying to access memoery you don't have access to. 

#Task 3
You're not checking for the end of the string so you'll just keep trying to access the next memory spot, which leads to the program checking memory that it does not have access to.
