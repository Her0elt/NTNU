It provides corporate-wide data integration, usually from one or more operational systems or external information providers, and is cross-functional in scope. It typically contains detailed data as
well as summarized data, and can range in size from a few gigabytes to hundreds of gigabytes, terabytes, or beyond. An enterprise data warehouse may be implemented on traditional mainframes, computer super servers, or parallel architecture
platforms. It requires extensive business modeling and may take years to design and build.</li></ul><ul id="5e8c4332-e485-42af-8354-d3655e7804e9" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Data mart: A data mart contains a subset of corporate-wide data that is of value to a
specific group of users. The scope is confined to specific selected subjects. For example, a marketing data mart may confine its subjects to customer, item, and sales. The
data contained in data marts tend to be summarized.
Data marts are usually implemented on low-cost departmental servers that are
Unix/Linux or Windows based. The implementation cycle of a data mart is more
likely to be measured in weeks rather than months or years. However, it may
involve complex integration in the long run if its design and planning were not
enterprise-wide. Depending on the source of data, data marts can be categorized as independent or dependent. Independent data marts are sourced from data captured from one or more operational systems or external information providers, or from data generated
locally within a particular department or geographic area. Dependent data marts are
sourced directly from enterprise data warehouses.</li></ul><ul id="bb417bc6-f609-443e-8301-4865544275e9" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Virtual warehouse: A virtual warehouse is a set of views over operational databases.

a long time to develop, and lacks flexibility due to the difficulty in achieving consistency
and consensus for a common data model for the entire organization. The bottom-

First, a high-level corporate data model is defined within a reasonably short period
(such as one or two months) that provides a corporate-wide, consistent, integrated
view of data among different subjects and potential usages. This high-level model,
although it will need to be refined in the further development of enterprise data ware-

</p><p id="e5afa355-003a-4ecb-af64-f538545503da" class="">Star schema: The most common modeling paradigm is the star schema, in which the
data warehouse contains (1) a large central table (fact table) containing the bulk of
the data, with no redundancy, and (2) a set of smaller attendant tables (dimension
tables), one for each dimension. The schema graph resembles a starburst, with the
dimension tables displayed in a radial pattern around the central fact table.</p><p id="57b8e179-deb0-4983-8fe9-1cc15b33b1a3" class="">Snowflake schema: The snowflake schema is a variant of the star schema model,
where some dimension tables are normalized, thereby further splitting the data into
additional tables. The resulting schema graph forms a shape similar to a snowflake.</p><p id="eb32ad65-353e-4a86-997d-3e9661af53d6" class="">The major difference between the snowflake and star schema models is that the
dimension tables of the snowflake model may be kept in normalized form to reduce
redundancies. Such a table is easy to maintain and saves storage space. However, this
space savings is negligible in comparison to the typical magnitude of the fact table. Furthermore, the snowflake structure can reduce the effectiveness of browsing, since more
joins will be needed to execute a query. Consequently, the system performance may be
adversely impacted. Hence, although the snowflake schema reduces redundancy, it is not
as popular as the star schema in data warehouse design.</p><p id="29e01879-07e7-420f-ade8-1b2d8c9a1d19" class="">Fact constellation: Sophisticated applications may require multiple fact tables to share

manner as follows. Suppose the data are partitioned into n sets. We apply the func-
tion to each partition, resulting in n aggregate values. If the result derived by applying
the function to the n aggregate values is the same as that derived by applying the func-
tion to the entire data set (without partitioning), the function can be computed in a
distributed manner. For example, sum() can be computed for a data cube by first par-
titioning the cube into a set of subcubes, computing sum() for each subcube, and then
summing up the counts obtained for each subcube. Hence, sum() is a distributive
aggregate function. For the same reason, count() , min() , and max() are distributive aggregate functions. By treating the count value of each nonempty base cell as 1 by default, count() of any cell in a cube can be viewed as the sum of the count values of all of its corresponding
child cells in its subcube. Thus, count() is distributive. A measure is distributive if it is
obtained by applying a distributive aggregate function. Distributive measures can be
computed efficiently because of the way the computation can be partitioned.</li></ul><ul id="fb3631c7-79ec-43b9-8910-cf59ca1d5346" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Algebraic: An aggregate function is algebraic if it can be computed by an algebraic func-

age) can be computed by sum()/count() , where both sum() and count() are distributive
aggregate functions. Similarly, it can be shown that min N() and max N() (which
find the N minimum and N maximum values, respectively, in a given set) and
standard deviation() are algebraic aggregate functions. A measure is algebraic if it is

performs aggregation on a data cube, either by climbing up a concept hierarchy for
a dimension or by dimension reduction. Figure 4.12 shows the result of a roll-up
operation performed on the central cube by climbing up the concept hierarchy for
location given in Figure 4.9. This hierarchy was defined as the total order “street &lt;
city &lt; province or state &lt; country.” The roll-up operation shown aggregates the data
by ascending the location hierarchy from the level of city to the level of country. In
other words, rather than grouping the data by city, the resulting cube groups the data
by country. When roll-up is performed by dimension reduction, one or more dimensions are
removed from the given cube. For example, consider a sales data cube containing
only the location and time dimensions. Roll-up may be performed by removing, say,
the time dimension, resulting</p><p id="07331e3e-e30e-44e7-ae17-cd2261f9a8d6" class="">Drill-down: Drill-down is the reverse of roll-up. It navigates from less detailed data
to more detailed data. Drill-down can be realized by either stepping down a concept
hierarchy for a dimension or introducing additional dimensions. Figure 4.12 shows the
result of a drill-down operation performed on the central cube by stepping down a concept hierarchy for time defined as “day &lt; month &lt; quarter &lt; year.” Drill-down
occurs by descending the time hierarchy from the level of quarter to the more detailed
level of month. The resulting data cube details the total sales per month rather than
summarizing them by quarter.
Because a drill-down adds more detail to the given data, it can also be per-
formed by adding new dimensions to a cube. For example, a drill-down on the
central cube of Figure 4.12 can occur by introducing an additional dimension, such
as customer group.</p><p id="56769cec-a82e-4c7a-82da-34fec7f34fbb" class="">

data are selected from the central cube for the dimension time using the criterion
time = “Q1.” The dice operation defines a subcube by performing a selection on two
or more dimensions. Figure 4.12 shows a dice operation on the central cube based on
the following selection criteria that involve three dimensions: (location = “Toronto”

table. The drill-through operation uses relational SQL facilities to drill through the

Each one of these aggregations is called a cuboid. A set of these is a data cubes. One way to handle this is to extend SQL with compute cube operation that handles creating aggregations in multiple dimensions. The base cuboid is the cuboid that contains all the dimensions of a data cube, and the apex cube contains the 0-D cuboid where the group-by is empty. It is possible to precompute these cuboids, but this comes with the problem called the curse of dimensionality, this relates to the problem that comes with large dimensionality needing a lot of storage space. It is normal to say that you need 2^n space to store all your dimension, but some dimentions might have levels which leads to more storage need. A better model is Sum(1 - n, Li + 1) where Li is the number of levels for dimension i.  </p><p id="18fdf010-c269-49f5-b910-83a6979062e8" class="">
